this repository runs tailscale on github actions and uses it as exit node.
the purpose of this research is to measure average resource usage of tailscale when running as exit node.
we try to keep cpu and ram usage as low as possible by running just tailscale, vnc, ssh and a simple xfce setup to both increase research accuracy and not being abusive for github actions
